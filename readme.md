# What is this
This is the output of our first PocDay! (PocDay is a product of Protacon Solutions Ltd. where we make a Proof of Concept [or such] for our customer for fixed price within 24 hours.) The output is a POC of a mobile interface where the user can search for specific services.

## Backlog
- [ ] As customer *i want to search nearest good workshop* for my car. *Workshop should fix my car brand*. This because my car
seems to be broken (strange noise eg.).
- [ ] *As user i want to see local workshops as list.* List should be filtered for my car brand. I want to see most important basic information
of workshops.
- [ ] *As user i want to see further information of selected workshop*. For example address, phone number and location.
- [ ] *As user i want to use 'contact me' form where i can request further information*. For example when i can bring my car.
- [ ] *As user i want to see any offers local workshops has for me*.
- [ ] As user i can buy selected offer.

## Other requirements
- [ ] Application is used on browser.
- [ ] Application is designed mostly for tablet and phone.
- [ ] Use commonly used OS technologies.
- [ ] Product owner can enter new data for demo purposes.

# Installation, configure and usage
## Preconditions
First of all you have to install `npm` and `node.js` to your box - note that `NodeJS 6+` is required. See following links to help you with installation:
* [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
* [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)

## Installation
Open your shell/terminal and navigate to root of application folder and run following command:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration
Copy ```[./src/config/config.json_example](./src/config/config.json_example)``` file to ```./src/config/config.json``` and make necessary changes to it. 

## Usage
Application contains following commands that you can use
* `npm run dev-server` => starts dev servers, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* `npm run lint` => Lint your code under `.src` folder
* `npm run test` => Run unit tests
* `npm run build` => create build for production deployment, output will be generated to `dist` folder
* `npm run build-dev` => create build for development deployment, output will be generated to `public` folder

## Backend
This application relies that your backend implements following functionality.

### Endpoints / actions:
1) POST _your_backend_url/auth/getToken
 * Request payload ```{"username": "some_username", "password": "some_password"}```
 * Response ```{"token": "JWT hash", "refresh_token": "Refresh token hash"}```
2) GET _your_backend_url/auth/profile

### JWT handling
Your backend must support JWT on authenticate and authorization. After successfully login each request will contain ```Authorization: Bearer JsonWebTokenHere``` header which your backend much validate.

Also note that actual JsonWebToken must contain ```roles``` attribute which is an array that contains user roles. These roles must match with [userRoles.js](src/core/auth/constants/userRoles.js) definitions.

Example of decoded JsonWebToken:
```json
{
  "exp": 1474307796,
  "username": "admin",
  "ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
  "agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.113 Safari/537.36",
  "checksum": "8939095afa51a37861b8e0fb4812d3ad893af2aec7604a25e29afe836e588678640ebaa6e001062274b2d2a97f20528771a43b0022e37eaebdefb7d0caa28d5c",
  "roles": [
    "ROLE_ROOT",
    "ROLE_ADMIN",
    "ROLE_USER",
    "ROLE_LOGGED"
  ],
  "firstname": "Arnold",
  "surname": "Administrator",
  "email": "arnold@administrator.com",
  "iat": "1474221396"
}
```

### CORS support
Your backend should have CORS enabled if you're going to host back- and frontend in different domains.

### Example backend
You can find simple backend solution [here](https://github.com/tarlepp/symfony-backend) which implements all required for this frontend application.

## Angular specific conventions

Application organisation rules:

1. Split app into angular "modules" 
 * every module should have own folder, and should be defined in one file which will require all module components and will export module name 
 * module can have nested modules
 * module can require other modules which are direct siblings of it or parent modules, or modules nested in it (if you need to require module that is nested in "sibling" - you you should move it up by hierarchy before requiring it)
2. Keep modules small - if module is too big, maybe it should be few modules 
3. Every file should have only one entity inside it, for example if there is directive which has controller and template - there should be three files, plus likely two for unit tests
4. Group related resources by folders
5. Name files with suffixes `.directive`, `.controller`, `.component`, `.factory`, `.service`, `.provider`, etc.
6. Use `.test` suffix for test file names

## Directives

1. Prefer to use isolated scopes
2. Use controllerAs syntax 
3. Controller should act as ViewModel, use $scope only if you need it
4. All model layer (data fetching, business logic) should be in services
